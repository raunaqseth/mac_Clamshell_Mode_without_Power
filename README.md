# mac_Clamshell_Mode_without_Power
Apple will not let you do that unless you have a power adapter connected to your MacBook. In order to use a MacBook in clamshell mode without keeping the charger always connected to it I have created this script that checks whether the device Clamshell Mode Status and gives you optoin to change it to default or without power.
